# cli

> A CLI for all of my JavaScript tooling needs

## Ideas

Executing a command without arguments will open up an interactive mode:

```sh
# Opens an interactive menu to show what actions to take
npx @macklinu/cli

# Opens an interactive menu to determine what to install,
# like linting tools, configuration files, etc.
npx @macklinu/cli install
```
